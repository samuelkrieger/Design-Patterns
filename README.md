<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



This project aims to explain the concepts of design patterns in a practical way using the java language.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Design patterns are models that have been used and tested before, so they can represent a good productivity gain for developers.

Its use also contributes to the organization and maintenance of projects, since these standards are based on low coupling between classes and standardization of the code.

In addition, with a standardization of terms, techniques are facilitated. It is easier to speak the name of a design pattern rather than having to explain all of its behavior.
